description: Install, diagnose, and configure the local `tts` CLI (local-tts) — backends (llama.cpp, piper, OpenAI-compatible), voices for a given language, playback, and the per-language provider memory. Use when text-to-speech is missing or broken, when the user wants a different or better voice, when they need a new language, or when they ask to change any speech setting.

# Configuring `local-tts`

Use this when speech does not work yet, sounds wrong, or needs a new language. For simply
speaking text that already works, use the `local-tts-speak` skill.

## Always start here

```bash
tts check
```

It prints the config file path, the default backend, one line per backend with `[ok]` or
`[--]` plus the reason, and the detected audio players. **Read it before changing
anything** — it usually names the exact problem.

`[--]` on a backend the user does not use is fine. Only the backend they need must be
`[ok]`.

## Rules

- **Ask before installing anything, downloading a voice (~60 MB each), or running `sudo`.**
- Show `tts check` output to the user rather than paraphrasing it.
- Never edit the config JSON by hand; use `tts config --set` so validation applies.
- If `tts` itself is missing, that is a full install: follow `AGENT_INSTALL.md` in the
  local-tts repository, not this skill.

## The four backends

| Backend | Offline | Languages | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `llamacpp` (default) | yes | **English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean only** | `llama-tts` binary |
| `piper` | yes | ~40 languages, fast | `piper` binary + a `.onnx` voice |
| `openai` | no | whatever the endpoint offers | a URL, and a key only for api.openai.com |
| `command` | yes | whatever the tool offers | any binary that writes a WAV |

**The single most common problem:** the user's text is not in one of llamacpp's four
languages, so it is pronounced with English phonetics. The fix is piper, not a setting.

## Adding a language with piper

Check whether piper exists first:

```bash
tts check | grep piper
```

If it is missing, install it **in its own virtualenv** — piper pulls in onnxruntime and
numpy (~200 MB), and local-tts is deliberately dependency-free.

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.local/share/piper-venv
~/.local/share/piper-venv/bin/pip install piper-tts
PIPER=~/.local/share/piper-venv/bin/piper
VOICES=~/.local/share/piper-voices
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
py -m venv $env:LOCALAPPDATA\piper-venv
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\piper-venv\Scripts\pip.exe" install piper-tts
$PIPER = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\piper-venv\Scripts\piper.exe"
$VOICES = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\piper-voices"
```

Note the differences on Windows: the launcher is `py` (or `python`, never `python3`), the
scripts live in `Scripts\` rather than `bin/`, and executables end in `.exe`.

Then pick a voice. **Ask the user which language and region** — accent matters to people:

```bash
# Linux / macOS — list every voice, then fetch one
~/.local/share/piper-venv/bin/python -m piper.download_voices
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/piper-voices && cd ~/.local/share/piper-voices
~/.local/share/piper-venv/bin/python -m piper.download_voices es_MX-claude-high
```

```powershell
# Windows
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\piper-venv\Scripts\python.exe" -m piper.download_voices
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\piper-voices" | Out-Null
Set-Location "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\piper-voices"
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\piper-venv\Scripts\python.exe" -m piper.download_voices es_MX-claude-high
```

Voice names read `<lang>_<REGION>-<speaker>-<quality>`, quality being
`x_low | low | medium | high`. Prefer the region matching the user's audience — `es_MX` for
Latin America, `es_ES` for Spain, `pt_BR` vs `pt_PT`, and so on. Voices come from
`rhasspy/piper-voices` on Hugging Face: public, MIT/CC, **no API token or account**.

Register it and record the language preference:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
tts config --set piper.binary=~/.local/share/piper-venv/bin/piper
tts config --set piper.model=~/.local/share/piper-voices/es_MX-claude-high.onnx
tts languages --set es=piper:~/.local/share/piper-voices/es_MX-claude-high.onnx
tts --lang es "Prueba de voz."      # verify it out loud
```

```powershell
# Windows — pass full paths; ~ is not expanded by PowerShell
tts config --set "piper.binary=$env:LOCALAPPDATA\piper-venv\Scripts\piper.exe"
tts config --set "piper.model=$env:LOCALAPPDATA\piper-voices\es_MX-claude-high.onnx"
tts languages --set "es=piper:$env:LOCALAPPDATA\piper-voices\es_MX-claude-high.onnx"
tts --lang es "Prueba de voz."
```

Recording the language is not optional bookkeeping — it is how every agent knows what to
use next time.

## The language memory

```bash
tts languages                                   # what is remembered
tts languages --set es=piper:/path/voice.onnx    # record
tts languages --set en=llamacpp                  # provider only
tts languages --forget de                        # drop one
```

Lookups match the specific tag before the base one, so `es-MX` wins over `es` when both
exist. Update this whenever the user expresses a preference, and confirm what you recorded.

## Playback control

Audio started with `tts -b` is detached, so it can be controlled afterwards:

```bash
tts playback     # playing / paused / nothing, plus the file
tts stop
tts pause        # POSIX only (Linux, macOS, WSL)
tts resume
```

If the user reports that audio "will not stop", run `tts playback` first — if it reports
nothing, the sound is coming from something else, not this CLI. A stale state file is
harmless: the next `stop` clears it.

## Other settings

```bash
tts config --show                       # effective configuration
tts config --path                       # where it lives
tts config --set provider=piper         # default backend
tts config --set play=false             # never auto-play
tts config --set player=ffplay          # force a playback command

# llama.cpp performance
tts config --set llamacpp.threads=8
tts config --set llamacpp.gpu_layers=99
tts config --set llamacpp.max_words=26  # prompt chunk size; 0 disables chunking

# an OpenAI-compatible server (no key needed for a local one)
tts config --set openai.base_url=http://localhost:8880/v1
tts -p openai -o out.mp3 "hello"
```

Per-run overrides that change nothing permanently: `tts -s threads=4 "..."`.

## Diagnosing

| `tts check` / error says | Meaning | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `'llama-tts' not found on PATH` | llama.cpp missing | install it, or `tts config --set llamacpp.binary=/full/path` |
| `model set without a vocoder` | llamacpp needs both files | set `llamacpp.vocoder`, or clear `llamacpp.model` to use defaults |
| `no voice model configured` | piper has no `.onnx` | download one, set `piper.model` |
| `('x' is not on PATH)` on `command` | template points at a missing binary | install it or change the template |
| `no api_key and $OPENAI_API_KEY is unset` | only matters if they use `openai` | export the key, or ignore |
| `players : none found` | no audio player (Linux only) | install `ffmpeg`, or always use `-o` |
| right words, wrong accent | llamacpp used for an unsupported language | switch that language to piper |

Useful when something is off: `--verbose` streams the backend's own stderr, and `--dry-run`
prints the exact command (plus the chunk plan) without running it.

## Platform differences that actually matter

| | Linux | macOS | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python launcher | `python3` | `python3` | `py` or `python` |
| venv binaries | `<venv>/bin/` | `<venv>/bin/` | `<venv>\Scripts\` + `.exe` |
| Config file | `~/.config/local-tts/config.json` | same | `%APPDATA%\local-tts\config.json` if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset, else that |
| Audio player | needs one installed | `afplay`, built in | PowerShell player, built in |
| llama.cpp | package manager, release zip, or build | `brew install llama.cpp` | `winget install llama.cpp` |
| `~` in a config value | expanded by the CLI | expanded | **use a full path**; PowerShell will not expand it |

The CLI itself expands `~` in config values on every platform, so
`tts config --set piper.model=~/voices/x.onnx` is fine — the risk on Windows is the *shell*
not expanding it before the CLI sees it, which is why the examples above use
`$env:LOCALAPPDATA`.

Run commands one at a time rather than `&&`-chaining them; `&&` is not valid in older
PowerShell.

## Finish

Re-run `tts check`, speak one real sentence in the user's language, and tell them what you
changed, what you recorded in `tts languages`, and the one command they will use daily.
